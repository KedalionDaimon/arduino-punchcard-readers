# arduino-punchcard-readers
This repository contains code for experiments with punch card readers on Arduino.

The first such experiment is demonstrated here:

The corresponding code file is "punchcard3.ino", for Arduino Mega 2560.

The second experiment is to be found here:

Therein, an Arduino UNO running 1V0 Tz III is made to add two numbers and store the result - the Arduino serving as a sort of "mainframe controlled by punchcards". To-Do: Need to explain in detail how 1V0 Tz III is working, exactly; the main difference to regular 1V0 is that it works in three addresses, not in two, and the result is stored in the third address, not in the first. Also, more complex jumps are possible.
